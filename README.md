## 📝 Paper Summary

This study examined the developmental trajectories of infant attention-following (AF) skills—including **gaze-following, point-following, and gaze-plus-point-following**—from 4 to 12 months of age, using a longitudinal experimental design.

## Research Highlights

- Longitudinal tracking of infant AF skills over multiple months.
- Controlled paradigm accounting for motivation, attention, and visual search factors.
- Healthy infants reliably followed gaze and points only after 6 months, with slow, incremental gains through 12 months.
- Modest individual stability in AF skills emerged between 8–12 months.
