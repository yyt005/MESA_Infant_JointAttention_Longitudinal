## Paper Summary

This study examined the developmental trajectories of infant attention-following (AF) skills—including **gaze-following, point-following, and gaze-plus-point-following**—from 4 to 12 months of age, using a longitudinal experimental design.

## Research Highlights

- A longitudinal experimental study documented the emergence and developmental trajectories of North American middle-class infants' visual attention-following skills, including gaze-following, point-following, and gaze-and-point-following.
- An innovative paradigm controlled for factors including motivation, attentiveness, and visual-search baserates. Motor development was ruled out as a predictor or limiter of the emergence of attention-following.
- Infants did not follow attention reliably until after 6 months, and AF skills increased slowly from 7 to 12 months.
- Infants' individual trajectories showed modest month-to-month stability from 8 to 12 months of age.
