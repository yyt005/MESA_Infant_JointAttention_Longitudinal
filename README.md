Paper Summary

This study examined the developmental trajectories of infant attention-following (AF) skills—including gaze-following, point-following, and gaze-plus-point-following—from 4 to 12 months of age, using a longitudinal experimental design.

Research Highlights:
    •    Longitudinal tracking of infant AF skills over multiple months.
    •    Controlled paradigm accounting for motivation, attention, and visual search factors.
    •    Healthy infants reliably followed gaze and points only after 6 months, with slow, incremental gains through 12 months.
    •    Modest individual stability in AF skills emerged between 8–12 months.
